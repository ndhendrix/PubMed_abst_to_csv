# PubMed_abst_to_csv
 
When extracting results from PubMed, there doesn't seem (?) to be a simple way to extract the results as a CSV *and* include the abstract.

This is a quick and dirty way of converting the text file that includes the abstract to a CSV. The goal is to make it easier to conduct title and abstract screening.

Instructions for use:
1. Conduct your search in PubMed and save the results as _Abstract (text)_.
2. Change the working directory in this script to your working directory.
3. Change the file name to the file name of your saved results from the PubMed search.
4. Run the script.
5. (Optional) Make changes to this script if you catch it making any mistakes. ;-)
